pgfplots - A tool to draw normal and/or logarithmic plots in LaTeX.

Pgfplots draws high-quality function plots in normal or logarithmic
scaling with a user-friendly interface. The user supplies axis labels, legend
entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and Pgfplots applies
axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots.
It is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ.

Please take a look at 
  doc/latex/pgfplots/pgfplots.pdf. 
The manual contains installation instructions and more detailed information.
