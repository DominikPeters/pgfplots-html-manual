# Online version of the pgfplots manual

This is an HTML version of the [pgfplots](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgfplots) manual. It is available at https://tikz.dev/pgfplots/.

It is produced using the `lwarp` package, based on similar code as my [PGF/TikZ HTML manual](https://github.com/DominikPeters/pgf-tikz-html-manual). For feedback and bug reports, please use the issue tracker at https://github.com/DominikPeters/tikz.dev-issues/issues.

## Readme of the pgfplots package

pgfplots - Create normal/logarithmic plots in two and three dimensions for LaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.

pgfplotstable - Loads, rounds, formats and postprocesses numerical tables.

PGFPlots draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling
with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user supplies axis labels,
legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots
applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the
plots. It supports line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar
plots, area plots, mesh and surface plots, patch plots, contour plots, quiver
plots, histogram plots, polar axes, ternary diagrams, smith charts and some
more.

Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package PGF/TikZ (pgf).

Pgfplotstable displays numerical tables rounded to desired precision in various
display formats, for example scientific format, fixed point format or integer,
using TeX's math facilities for pretty printing. Furthermore, it provides
methods for table postprocessing.
