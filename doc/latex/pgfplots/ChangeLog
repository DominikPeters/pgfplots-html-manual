2008-06-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added column/{[index]5}/.style and 'column indizes/5/.style'
	- added 'select equal part entry of' style

2008-06-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added warning when loading tables '#1.tex' instead of '#1'.

2008-06-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved error recovery: empty plots are no discarded silently
	- added column 'alias' feature for tables
	- optimized code for grid line, tick line and tick label generation and
	replaced tikz commands by basic layer commands. 
	pgfplots is now 36% faster!
	- changed drawing sequence of axis lines and tick/grid lines. Now, tick
	lines are no longer drawn on top of axis lines.
	- introduced aliases 'axis y line=middle' and 'axis x line=center'
	- added named node 'current axis' which provides anchors 'origin', 
	'above origin', 'left of origin', 'right of origin' and 'below origin'
	-> this allows improvements of the non-boxed axis variants
	- added those anchors also to the normal anchors.
	- added styles 'every inner axis [xy] line'
	- added styles 'every outer axis [xy] line' [untested]
	- added command keys 'inner axis line style', 'outer axis line style' and
	'axis line style'

	|y filter|. Backwards compatibility is checked. Added docs.

	|extra description/.code|.

2008-06-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- I have replaced all /tikz/ options with /pgfplots/ ones. The
	documentation is updated to reflect this change. 
	Backwardscompatibility with \tikzstyle and the old /tikz/every... styles
	is provided. 

2008-05-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added \pgfnumtabletypeset feature. It is quite sophisticated by now and
	allows to typeset (selected parts of) numeric tables; rounds each number
	to desired accuracy and provides number format styles.

2008-05-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added special values 'xtick=data' and 'ytick=data' to collect the first plot's
	coordinates as tick data.

2008-05-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- First version of manual with pgfmanual styles is ready. It is not quite
	final, but should be enough to communicate with Pascal.
	- fixed plot expression to work properly.

2008-05-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added useful styles for all bar options.

	recently).

2008-05-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added \closedcycle command for use after \addplot. It connects the
	current plot with the x-axis to provide fillable plots easily.
	- added named coordinates 'current plot begin' and 'current plot end'

2008-05-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added support for stacked plots:
		- stack plots=x|y|false
		- reverse stacked plots=true|false
		- stack dir=plus|minus
	- rewrote some internals

2008-05-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	- added 'current plot style' key to \addplot
	- Added error bar support with fixed absolute/relative errors or explicit
	  absolute/relative errors for each coordinate.
	- added plot types for piecewise constant plots
	- added plot types 'ybar' and 'xbar' with option '/pgf/bar width'

	- fixed data scaling trafo: contained possiblity for cancellation of significant
	  digits
	- added limited support for \addlegendentry[]{}
	- removed clipping region for tick line placement
	- added options
	  'every axis plot no 1,2,3,4,...'
	  'every [xy] tick'
	  'every minor [xy] tick'
	  'every major [xy] tick'
	  and the same for s/tick/grid/
	  and the corresponding '[xy] tick style', 'minor [xy] tick style' ...

2008-04-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.98 beta
	Changes since version 0.92.4:
	- enlargelimits now works properly for logarithmic axes
	- added support for plot function (gnuplot interface)
	- added extra ticks which are drawn on top of the normal ticks
	- providing x limits will now automatically clip y and vice-versa
	- added option 'log identify minor tick positions'
	- added option 'log plot exponent style'
	- added option 'log number format code' and 'log base 10 number format code'
	- improved automatic tick placement for log plots
	   they are now scale dependend as for linear plots.
	- added 'at' option
	- cycle list and \legend now accept comma separated lists
	- added support for plot expression
	- re-implemented the internal plot representation as pgf node. This improves
	  the PGF integration:
		- you can access various axis anchor from outside,
		- you can easily clip parts of the axis out of the bounding box (useful for
		  alignment),
		- you can access named axis descriptions (legends, titles, labels,...)

	- the complete floating point number support has been integrated into PGF 2.0.
	  That means: there are options 
	   /pgf/number format/sci
	   /pgf/number format/fixed
	   /pgf/number format/....
	   BUT
	   numbers are now printed with
	   \pgfmathprintnumber
	   NOT 
	   \prettyprintnumber   [ INCOMPATIBLE ]

	- added option 'scaled ticks'
	  and associated styles 
		'every x tick scale label'
		'every y tick scale label'
	  and options
		'x tick scale label style'
		'y tick scale label style'
	  and parameters
		'scale ticks [below,above] exponent'

	- legends have been improved (was \edef, is now better)

	- Any styles can now contain axis options, for example
		\tikzstyle{every axis legend}+=[legend columns=2]
	- added option "cycle list"
	- added option "cycle list name"
	- added '\addplot plot file {filename}'
	- added '\addplot plot table[x=colnameA,y=colnameB] {filename}'
	  and   '\addplot plot table[xindex=numberA,yindex=numberB] {filename}'
	  and   '\addplot plot table[...] from {\macroname}' in conjunction with
	  '\numtableread{FILE} to \macroname'

	- eliminated several scopes such that node names for labels, titles and legends
	  will be known outside of an axis,
	- added
		\tikzstyle{every semilogx axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every semilogy axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every loglog axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every linear axis}=[]
	- added option 'legend style'
	- added option 'label style'
	  added option 'x label style'
	  added option 'y label style'
	  added option 'grid style'
	  added option 'tick style'
	  and the same for all 'every ...' styles.
	  added option 'style=' option


2008-02-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.92.4
	Changes since version 0.92:
	** UPGRADE INCOMPATIBILITIES **
	- Warning: I have greatly improved the legend placement.
	  If you have overwritten 
		\tikzstyle{every axis legend}
	  you will need to update the legend!
	- renamed 'manual.pdf' to 'pgfplots.pdf' to allow 
		'texdoc pgfplots'
	- any \axispath commands need to use the 'axis cs' coordinate system.

	Improvements:
	- introduced a data scale transformation:
	  know, pgfplots is no longer restricted to numbers within 
	  TeX's limited precision.
	  It can produce plots with numbers of order O(10^10) or O(10^-10) (now even for non-logarithmic plots)
	- fixed a bug which did not allow scientific notation for normal plots,
	- improved default tick placement for normal plots,
	- enlargelimits option is now relative and has a better user interface,
	- legends are now TikZ matrizes, which fixes some bugs and improves their
	  flexibility.
	- Added the 'legend columns' option.
	- Added the 'legend plot pos' option.
	- Added the 'hide axis' option
	- Added the 'scale only axis' option
	- Added the 'xticklabels=LIST' and 'yticklabels=LIST' options
	- Added anchors to axes to allow horizontal/vertical alignment
	- rounded tick labels to \prettyprintnumberprecision digits
	- Added 'grid=major|minor|both|none' option for grid lines
	- Added '[xy]minorgrids',  '[xy]majorgrids' options and corresponding styles
	- Added '[xy]majorticks', 'ticks=major|minor|both|none' options ticks
