2008-11-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- optimiziation of \pgfmathfloattofixed yields 7% time savings for
	pgfplotstest. For plots with many points it will be even more.

2008-11-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added '/pgfplots/refstyle={label}' key.
	- added 'read completely' key.
	- fixed bug with error bars: some of the latest changes must have been
	during sleep.
	- eliminated 6 dimen registers.

2008-11-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- document bounding box modifications with 'overlay' option of pgf.
	The examples require the latest CVS version of pgf, because pgf 2.00 has a
	bug here (overlay and matrizes).

2008-11-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added 'scaled ticks=manual' feature. It allows complete control
	over the scaled tick algorithm and scaled tick label placement.
	- improved support for french language, i.e. for active ';' and ':'
	characters. The manual does not compile completely if switched to french,
	but it is not much.
	- updated pgfplotstable such that it can be adopted to more general tasks.
	As example, html file output has been added to the manual.

2008-11-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	- the clickable lib can now be used independently of pgfplots.

2008-11-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved compatibility between pgfplotstable and colortbl: \rowcolor
	and dec sep align (sci sep align) now works properly.
	- Added 'every col no <index>' style as alias for 'display columns/<index>'.
	- provided error message if \pgfplotstablerow is used in the wrong
	context.
	- improved pgfplots documentation.
	- improved pgfplotstable documentation
	- 'sci sep align' and 'dec sep align' now only enable math mode for their
	numbers, not for empty columns.

2008-11-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added error bar adjustments for 'ybar' style
	- fixed bug: error bars are now drawn after the main path

2008-11-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed missing code portion for scatter and log plots
	- added 'view' option which allows to specify pitch and yaw for definition
	  of a 3D viewport (definition of x,y and z unit vectors of PGF).

2008-11-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- documented default values of cycle lists.

2008-11-04 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- prepared more code for 3D-axis drawing. It is growing now and won't take 
	long for good-looking 3D figures.

2008-10-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- used 'y domain='<empty> as feature for \addplot3 (\x,\x,\x):
	this will sample from a line, not from a surface.

2008-10-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- implemented user interface to manually place 2D/3D tick LABELS (docs
	missing).
	  The next step is to predefine them automatically for 3D plots.

2008-10-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- renamed 'scatter plot' keys to 'scatter'
	- improved scatter plot user interface (not yet documented in parts)
	- implemented input methods for scatter coordinates (not yet documented)
	- worked on 3D axis generation.

2008-10-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Implemented colormaps.
	- Implemented scatter plots.

2008-10-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed a bug introduced in latest changes: 'tick align' produced wrongly
	positioned tick labels.


2008-10-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed a bug related to auto-tick placement and special cases of the
	scaling transformation.
	- Documented the new freedom in axis unit vector placement, reversed and
	skewed axes.
	- Introduced optimization for orthogonal axes.

2008-10-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added 'copy' and 'sqrt' features to table package.


2008-10-20 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Revised all new routines such that the 2D framework is running again.
	  All 2D tests appear to be ok.
	  The 3D stuff is neither documented nor ready, although early things
	  work. In the moment, it is only slowing things down, see todo.
	- Updated clickable lib to work with the new framework.
	- Removed remaining plain TeX '\loop' commands

2008-10-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Restored state of 2008-09-25 because something did not work and I don't
	have a stable version yet.
	- Updated compatiblity for pgf 2.0: inserted 'min exponent for 1000 sep'
	into compatibility files

2008-10-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- implemented input routines for 3D plots using \addplot3:
		- coordinates,
		- gnuplot,
		- file,
		- table,
		- expression.
	- updated coordinate streaming methods to work with 3D data.
	  I also cleaned and optimized the 2D code.
	  -> stacked plots and error bars do not reflect this yet!
	- added 'plot function[<further behavior options>]' which are merged
	together with those after 'plot[<behavior options>]'

2008-10-04 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- implemented first running 3D axis with orthogonal projection.
	  Most features work, especially tick placement, grid lines, tick label
	  placement. Some detail decisions of how to things look pretty have to
	  be done and realized. Scaling does not work yet and there are still
	  plenty of open problems. The user interface for setting views is crual.

2008-10-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed bug related to 'current axis' and origin anchors which occured
	  if axis limits have been restricted manually and axis descriptions
	  employed origin anchors.
	- continued the change to logical coordinates.

2008-10-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- changed internals to use logical coordinates consistently.
	- Added feature 'x={(10pt,-3pt)}, y=-1pt'; allowing
		- skewed axes,
		- reversed axes,
		- rotated axes,
	  as preparation for 3d plots.

2008-09-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- optimized number processing and log computations. Logs are now a factor
	of 3.8 faster.

2008-09-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Provided options to manually configure the tick scaling algorithm:
	either 1/10^<exponent> or 1/<real>  can be configured.
	- Added check for PGF 2.00 availability

2008-09-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Placed all drawing commands for plots and markers into separate scopes
	to end the effect of 'fill opacity' and 'dotted' styles.
	FIXME: check whether this affects any named nodes and such!

2008-09-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Improved compatibility with figure-environments. I had to turn
	"hidden=false" to fix this incompatiblity. I hope this does not produce
	visible artefacts... needs to be checked.

2008-09-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added 'include outfiles' option to table package, together with 
	'force remake'

2008-09-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed spacing bug in table package.
	- outfile and debug feature of table package now produce proper newlines.

2008-09-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added error messages if the table typeset features rely on LaTeX
	packages (array,booktabs) which have not yet been loaded.

2008-09-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added 'clear infinite' postprocessor to table package.

2008-09-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- re-implemented minimum and maximum computation because the PGF math
	parser interface has been changed. The changes are backwards compatible
	now.
	- fixed a bug in logarithm computation.
	- fixed some bugs related to the pgfplotsclickable library

2008-09-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Provided sanity checking for gradient computation in table package:
	division by zero now leads to empty cells.

2008-08-22 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added pgfplotsclickable library which displays point coordinates when
	clicking into the plot region (acrobat reader only; relies on acrotex
	bundle)

2008-08-04 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Release 1.1

2008-08-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added a library for abstract types of input coordinates (for example
	dates).

2008-08-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- change 'every axis grid' default style to 'thin,black!25'. This is less
	intrusive than 'help lines'.
	- fixed small bug in tick routines: they did not account for tikz drawing
	modes so 'draw=none' was ignored.
	- fixed context test cases
	- Improved manual

2008-08-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added several aliases for style keys. Something like 'x tick label
	style' always requires manual lookups while 'xticklabel style' is at least
	consistent with the 'xticklabel' key.

2008-07-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added environment 'pgfplotsinterruptdatabb'
	- fixed bug in |minor tick num|
	- fixed bug in alias feature of table package.

2008-07-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added |xtick pos| and |ytick pos| keys and |[xy]ticklabel pos|


2008-07-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed bug in 'plot table' optimization: did not allow for 'alias'ed
	columns.

2008-07-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved manual
	- provided better default key-paths such that '/pgfplots' can be omitted
	in many places.
	- Added \label / \ref support. Now, single plots can be referenced and
	\ref{label} inserts the associated legend image.

2008-07-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- markers are now drawn separately, after the clipped range. Instead of
	clipping their *paths*, their positions are clipped: a marker is either
	drawn completely or not at all.
	- The option 'clip marker paths' can be used for backwards compatibility
	- added |axis on top| key for area plots: in this case, axis descriptions
	are drawn on top of plot graphics.

2008-07-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Now, plot table{<file>} has linear runtime.
	- implemented fast low-level lists also for errorbars.

2008-07-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- I worked on the coordinate lists and finally got linear runtime.
	In fact, the idea of Till turned out to be the most effective one (although 
	it is only preasymtotically linear).
	- This makes the aftergroup-stack variable unnecessary. 
	- Some aspects are missing,	but I hope I can fix them soon.

2008-07-16 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- replaced tikz-drawing commands for plots with basic layer commands.
	Gain: about 12% faster than before!
	- added |use aftergroup stack as fast list| to allow O(N) time for large scale plot
	commands, given appropriate safe stack parameters of TeX.
	 

2008-07-15 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- implemented support for axis limits of order up to 1.0e+-2147483644

2008-07-14 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added support to simplify access the previous row during create table column
	statements. Added one more numeric column creation style.
	- added 'exp sep align' and improved 'dec sep align'.

2008-07-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- modified axis label placement for 'axis [xy] line' variations.
	  I think it's ok now...
	- documented how to get multiple y axis
	- modified log plot tick generation algorithm, I forget something
	yesterday.

2008-07-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed log plot tick generation if the axis range is extremely small.

2008-07-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- moved a lot of directories and files around to better match the TeX
	directory structure (TDS)
	- used 'every mark' style for mark options - allows to append style
	options.

2008-07-08 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added 'postproc cell content' feature to table package
	- added 'preproc cell content' feature to table package
	- fixed plot limit bugs arising in special situations

2008-07-07 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved several things in table package
	- partial limits are now supported, for example 'xmin=4' or 'ymax=15'
	- improved empty axis range handling
	- modified transformations to avoid 'number too large/small' errors
	- enlargelimits respects partial limits
	- evaluated 'every axis plot' and 'every axis plot no <number>' in
	\addplot commands, allowing not only style options but also behavior
	options.


2008-07-04 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- implemented title, xlabel and ylabel as direct keys in pgf, allowing to
	add suffixes or prefixes to already assigned values.

2008-07-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added default styles for non-boxed axis lines. This is more or less
	experimental up to now and may still change.

2008-07-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed small issues in pgfplotstable manual
	- eliminated one dimen register and one count register

2008-07-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added semicolon to gnuplot invocation to fix the strange behavior of
	windows gnuplot.

2008-06-30 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- solved the problem of arrow heads and different styles for axis *lines*.
	Not quite satisfactory, because one needs to choose between closed paths
	and clean edges on the one hand and separate arrow heads or styles on the
	other hand. See the documentation for details.

2008-06-29 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- wrote some styles for the 'create col' framework, namely to compute
	piecewise gradients and quotients from one row to the next.

2008-06-28 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Wrote a \pgfplotstablecreatecol command to generate new columns in a
	quite general fashion.

2008-06-27 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- renamed the last change from 'column/{[index]5}/.style' to
	'display columns/5/.style' because it was not consistent.
	- implemented code to balance rows in typeset table routines.
	The first column is the measure, all other ones will be forced to
	match its row count.
	- documented new features.
	- added |hide x axis| and |hide y axis|.
	- added |enlarge x limits| and |enlarge y limits|.
	- Added key |legend entries|.

2008-06-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added column/{[index]5}/.style and 'column indizes/5/.style'
	- added 'select equal part entry of' style

2008-06-25 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added warning when loading tables '#1.tex' instead of '#1'.

2008-06-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved error recovery: empty plots are now discarded silently
	- added column 'alias' feature for tables
	- optimized code for grid line, tick line and tick label generation and
	replaced tikz commands by basic layer commands. 
	pgfplots is now 36% faster!
	- changed drawing sequence of axis lines and tick/grid lines. Now, tick
	lines are no longer drawn on top of axis lines.
	- introduced aliases 'axis y line=middle' and 'axis x line=center'
	- added named node 'current axis' which provides anchors 'origin', 
	'above origin', 'left of origin', 'right of origin' and 'below origin'
	-> this allows improvements of the non-boxed axis variants
	- added those anchors also to the normal anchors.
	- added styles 'every inner [xy] axis line'
	- added styles 'every outer [xy] axis line' [untested]
	- added command keys 'inner axis line style', 'outer axis line style' and
	'axis line style'

2008-06-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- improved ConTeXt compatibility

2008-06-17 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed incompatibility between 'plot function' and german active "
	character

2008-06-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Released version 1.0

2008-06-11 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added boolean |row predicate| to select table entries.
	- added macro |\coordindex| inside of \addplot to allow index based
	  coordinate filters.
	- added style keys |/pgfplots/skip coords between index| and
	  |/pgfplots/table/skip rows between index|
	- added style |dec sep align| for table typesetting.

2008-06-10 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Fixed several warnings in manual
	- reimplemented |minor tick num| as style which sets the [xy] variants

2008-06-09 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Replaced |xfilter| and |yfilter| by code keys |x filter/.code={...}| and
	|y filter|. Backwards compatibility is checked. Added docs.

2008-06-09 Pascal Wolkotte <wolkottept@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added |minor x tick num| and |minor y tick num| option
	- Adjusted section title format in documentation
	- Filtered x and y tick's if axis x/y line is middle or center

2008-06-07 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Wrote more documentation, added |every axis plot post| style.
	- Added |col sep=<space|comma|colon|semicolon|braces>| option for table
	input.

2008-06-06 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added |minor tick num| option

2008-06-05 Pascal Wolkotte <wolkottept@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added options to choose the drawing of the axis lines
	- Added options to include a discontinuity decoration on the axis lines
	- Added options to align ticks with the axis lines

2008-06-03 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Added options |before end axis/.code| and |after end axis/.code| and
	|extra description/.code|.

2008-06-02 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- I have replaced all /tikz/ options with /pgfplots/ ones. The
	documentation is updated to reflect this change. 
	Backwardscompatibility with \tikzstyle and the old /tikz/every... styles
	is provided. 

2008-05-31 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added \pgfnumtabletypeset feature. It is quite sophisticated by now and
	allows to typeset (selected parts of) numeric tables; rounds each number
	to desired accuracy and provides number format styles.

2008-05-26 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added special values 'xtick=data' and 'ytick=data' to collect the first plot's
	coordinates as tick data.

2008-05-24 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- First version of manual with pgfmanual styles is ready. It is not quite
	final, but should be enough to communicate with Pascal.
	- fixed plot expression to work properly.

2008-05-21 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added useful styles for all bar options.

2008-05-20 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- fixed some issues with stacked plots
	- added public macros \plotnum and \numplots inside of an axis
	- added options '[xy] tick label as interval=true|false'
	- added support for 'ybar interval' plot handler (which I added to PGF
	recently).

2008-05-19 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added \closedcycle command for use after \addplot. It connects the
	current plot with the x-axis to provide fillable plots easily.
	- added named coordinates 'current plot begin' and 'current plot end'

2008-05-18 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>

	- added support for stacked plots:
		- stack plots=x|y|false
		- reverse stacked plots=true|false
		- stack dir=plus|minus
	- rewrote some internals

2008-05-12 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	- added 'current plot style' key to \addplot
	- Added error bar support with fixed absolute/relative errors or explicit
	  absolute/relative errors for each coordinate.
	- added plot types for piecewise constant plots
	- added plot types 'ybar' and 'xbar' with option '/pgf/bar width'

	- fixed data scaling trafo: contained possiblity for cancellation of significant
	  digits
	- added limited support for \addlegendentry[]{}
	- removed clipping region for tick line placement
	- added options
	  'every axis plot no 1,2,3,4,...'
	  'every [xy] tick'
	  'every minor [xy] tick'
	  'every major [xy] tick'
	  and the same for s/tick/grid/
	  and the corresponding '[xy] tick style', 'minor [xy] tick style' ...

2008-04-23 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.98 beta
	Changes since version 0.92.4:
	- enlargelimits now works properly for logarithmic axes
	- added support for plot function (gnuplot interface)
	- added extra ticks which are drawn on top of the normal ticks
	- providing x limits will now automatically clip y and vice-versa
	- added option 'log identify minor tick positions'
	- added option 'log plot exponent style'
	- added option 'log number format code' and 'log base 10 number format code'
	- improved automatic tick placement for log plots
	   they are now scale dependend as for linear plots.
	- added 'at' option
	- cycle list and \legend now accept comma separated lists
	- added support for plot expression
	- re-implemented the internal plot representation as pgf node. This improves
	  the PGF integration:
		- you can access various axis anchor from outside,
		- you can easily clip parts of the axis out of the bounding box (useful for
		  alignment),
		- you can access named axis descriptions (legends, titles, labels,...)

	- the complete floating point number support has been integrated into PGF 2.0.
	  That means: there are options 
	   /pgf/number format/sci
	   /pgf/number format/fixed
	   /pgf/number format/....
	   BUT
	   numbers are now printed with
	   \pgfmathprintnumber
	   NOT 
	   \prettyprintnumber   [ INCOMPATIBLE ]

	- added option 'scaled ticks'
	  and associated styles 
		'every x tick scale label'
		'every y tick scale label'
	  and options
		'x tick scale label style'
		'y tick scale label style'
	  and parameters
		'scale ticks [below,above] exponent'

	- legends have been improved (was \edef, is now better)

	- Any styles can now contain axis options, for example
		\tikzstyle{every axis legend}+=[legend columns=2]
	- added option "cycle list"
	- added option "cycle list name"
	- added '\addplot plot file {filename}'
	- added '\addplot plot table[x=colnameA,y=colnameB] {filename}'
	  and   '\addplot plot table[xindex=numberA,yindex=numberB] {filename}'
	  and   '\addplot plot table[...] from {\macroname}' in conjunction with
	  '\numtableread{FILE} to \macroname'

	- eliminated several scopes such that node names for labels, titles and legends
	  will be known outside of an axis,
	- added
		\tikzstyle{every semilogx axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every semilogy axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every loglog axis}=[]
		\tikzstyle{every linear axis}=[]
	- added option 'legend style'
	- added option 'label style'
	  added option 'x label style'
	  added option 'y label style'
	  added option 'grid style'
	  added option 'tick style'
	  and the same for all 'every ...' styles.
	  added option 'style=' option


2008-02-01 Christian Feuersaenger <ludewich@users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.92.4
	Changes since version 0.92:
	** UPGRADE INCOMPATIBILITIES **
	- Warning: I have greatly improved the legend placement.
	  If you have overwritten 
		\tikzstyle{every axis legend}
	  you will need to update the legend!
	- renamed 'manual.pdf' to 'pgfplots.pdf' to allow 
		'texdoc pgfplots'
	- any \axispath commands need to use the 'axis cs' coordinate system.

	Improvements:
	- introduced a data scale transformation:
	  know, pgfplots is no longer restricted to numbers within 
	  TeX's limited precision.
	  It can produce plots with numbers of order O(10^10) or O(10^-10) (now even for non-logarithmic plots)
	- fixed a bug which did not allow scientific notation for normal plots,
	- improved default tick placement for normal plots,
	- enlargelimits option is now relative and has a better user interface,
