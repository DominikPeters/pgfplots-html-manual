\section[libs.dateplot]{Dates as Input Coordinates}

\begin{pgfplotslibrary}{dateplot}
    A library which allows to use dates like |2008-01-01| or dates with time
    like |2008-01-01 11:35| as input coordinates in plots. The library converts
    dates to numbers and tick labels will be pretty-printed dates (or times).

    This library is documented in Section~\ref{sec:pgfplots:date:coords}.
