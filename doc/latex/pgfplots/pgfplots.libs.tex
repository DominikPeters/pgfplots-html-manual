\section{Related Libraries}
This section describes some libraries which come with \PGFPlots, but they are more or less special and need to be activated separately.

\subsection{Dates as Input Coordinates}
\begin{tikzlibrary}{dateplot}
	A library which allows to use dates like |2008-01-01| as input coordinates in plots. The library converts dates to numbers and tick labels will be pretty-printed dates.

	This library is documented in section~\ref{pgfplots:sec:symbolic:coords} on page~\pageref{pgfplots:sec:date:coords}.
\end{tikzlibrary}

\subsection{Clickable Plots}
\begin{tikzlibrary}{pgfplotsclickable}
	A library which generates small popups whenever one clicks into a plot. The popup displays the coordinate under the mouse pointer. Furthermore, the library allows to display slopes if one holds the mouse pressed and drags it to another point in the plot.

	It is completely sufficient to write
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\usetikzlibrary{pgfplotsclickable}
\end{codeexample}
	\noindent in the document preamble. This will automatically prepare every plot.

	The library works with Acrobat Javascript and \pdf\ forms: every plot becomes a push--button. 

	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/pgfplotsclickable-fig1.png}
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/pgfplotsclickable-fig2.png}

	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/pgfplotsclickable-fig3.png}
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/pgfplotsclickable-fig4.png}

	\nobreak
	These screenshots show the result of clicking into the axis range (left column) and of dragging from one point to another (right column). The second case shows start- and end points and the slope of the line segment in--between.

	This document has been produces with |pgfplotsclickable|, so it is possible to load it into Acrobat Reader and simply click into a plot.

	A click places an annotation at the coordinate under the mouse pointer, a snap--to--nearest feature is not available (yet?).

	\paragraph{Requirements:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The library relies on the \LaTeX\ packages |insdljs| (``Insert document level Javascript'') and |eforms| which are both part of the freely available |AcroTeX| education bundle~\cite{acrotex}\footnote{These packages rely on \LaTeX, so the library is only available for \LaTeX, not for plain \TeX\ or Con\TeX t.}. The |insdljs| package creates a temporary file with extension |.djs|.
		
		\item At the time of this writing, only Adobe Acrobat Reader interpretes Javascript and Forms properly. The library doesn't have any effect if the resulting document is used in other viewers (as far as I know).

	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{Compatibility issues:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The library works only with |pdflatex|, |dvips| or |dvipdfm| are not supported\footnote{In fact, they should be. I don't really know why they don't $\hdots$ any hint is welcome.}.

		\item Up to now, it is \emph{not} possible to use this library in conjunction with the image externalization methods of section~\ref{sec:pgfplots:importexport}. 
		
		To be more precise, the exported \pdf\ documents will work correctly, but the |\includegraphics| command does not import the dynamic features.
		Please note that the exported \pdf\ documents will only work if |\usepackage[pdftex]{eforms}| is placed \emph{before} loading \pgfname, \Tikz\ or \PGFPlots.

		\item The library automatically calls |\begin{Form}| at |\begin{document}| and |\end{Form}| at the end of the document. This environment of |hyperref| is necessary for dynamic user interaction and should be kept in mind if the document contains other form elements.
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{Acknowledgements:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I have used a javascript |sprintf| implementation of Kevin van Zonneveld~\cite{phptojs} (the javascript API has only a limited set of conversions).
	\end{itemize}
\end{tikzlibrary}

It is possible to customize |pgfplotsclickable| with several options.

\begin{pgfplotskey}{clickable=\mchoice{true,false} (initially true)}
	Allows to disable the library for single plots.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/js fillColor=\marg{javascript color} (initially ["RGB",1,1,.855])}
	Sets the background (fill) color of the short popup annotations. 
	
	Possible choices are |transparent|, gray, RGB or CMYK color specified as four--element--arrays of the form
	|["RGB", |\meta{red}|,|\meta{green}|,|\meta{blue}|]|. Each color component is between $0$ and $1$.

	Again: this option is for Javascript. It is \emph{not} possible to use colors as in \pgfname.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/point format=\marg{sprintf-format} (initially {(\%.1f,\%.1f)})}
	Allows to provide an |sprintf| format string which is used to fill the annotations with text. 
	The first argument to |sprintf| is the $x$-coordinate and the second argument is the $y$-coordinate.

	The |every semilogx axis|, |every semilogy axis| and |every loglog axis| styles have been updated to
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\pgfplotsset{
	every semilogy axis/.append style={/pgfplots/annot/point format={(\%.1f,\%.1e)}},
	every semilogx axis/.append style={/pgfplots/annot/point format={(\%.1e,\%.1f)}},
	every loglog axis/.append style={/pgfplots/annot/point format={(\%.1e,\%.1e)}}
}
\end{codeexample}
	\noindent such that every logarithmic coordinate is displayed in scientific format.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/slope format=\marg{sprintf-format} (initially \%.1f*x \%+.1f)}
	Allows to provide an |sprintf| format string which is used to fill the slope--annotation with text.
	The first argument is the slope and the second the line offset.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/printable=\mchoice{true,false} (initially false)}
	Allows to configure whether the small annotations will be printed. Otherwise, they are only available on screen.
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/font=\marg{javascript font name} (initially font.Times)}
	Allows to choose a javascript font for the annotations. Possible choices are limited to what javascripts accepts (which is \emph{not} the same as \LaTeX). The default fonts and its names are shown below.

	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\toprule
		Font Name	& Name in Javascript\\
		\midrule
		Times-Roman           & font.Times\\
        Times-Bold            & font.TimesB\\
        Times-Italic          & font.TimesI\\
        Times-BoldItalic      & font.TimesBI\\
        Helvetica             & font.Helv\\
        Helvetica-Bold        & font.HelvB\\
        Helvetica-Oblique     & font.HelvI\\
        Helvetica-BoldOblique & font.HelvBI\\
        Courier               & font.Cour\\
        Courier-Bold          & font.CourB\\
        Courier-Oblique       & font.CourI\\
        Courier-BoldOblique   & font.CourBI\\
        Symbol                & font.Symbol\\
        ZapfDingbats          & font.ZapfD\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{pgfplotskey}

\begin{pgfplotskey}{annot/textSize=\marg{Size in Point} (initially 11)}
	Sets the text size of annotations in points.
\end{pgfplotskey}
