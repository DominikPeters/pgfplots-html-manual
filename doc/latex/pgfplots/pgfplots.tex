\maketitle
\begin{abstract}%
\PGFPlots\ draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling with a user-friendly interface directly in \TeX. The user supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and \PGFPlots\ applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots, supporting line plots, piecewise constant plots, bar plots and area plots. It is based on Till Tantau's package \PGF/\Tikz.
\end{abstract}
\tableofcontents
\section{Introduction}
This package provides tools to generate plots and labeled axes easily. It draws normal plots, logplots and semi-logplots. Axis ticks, labels, legends (in case of multiple plots) can be added with key-value options. It can cycle through a set of predefined line/marker/color specifications. In summary, its purpose is to simplify the generation of high-quality function plots, especially for use in scientific contexts (logplots).

It is build completely on \Tikz\ and \PGF\ and may be used as \Tikz\ library. 

\section[About PGFPlots: Preliminaries]{About {\normalfont\PGFPlots}: Preliminaries}
This section contains information about upgrades, the team, the installation (in case you need to do it manually) and troubleshooting. You may skip it completely except for the upgrade remarks.

\subsection{Upgrade remarks}
This release provides a lot of improvements which can be found in all detail in \texttt{ChangeLog} for interested readers. However, some attention is useful with respect to the following changes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Due to a small math bug in \PGF\ $2.00$: you \emph{can't} write `|-x^2|' -- use `|0-x^2|' instead. The same holds for
		`|exp(-x^2)|' -- use `|exp(0-x^2)|' instead.

	\item Starting with \PGFPlots\ $1.1$, |\tizkstyle| should \emph{no longer be used} to set \PGFPlots\ options.
	
	Although |\tikzstyle| is still supported for some older \PGFPlots\ options, you should replace any occurance of |\tikzstyle| with |\pgfplotsset{|\meta{style name}|/.style={|\meta{key-value-list}|}}| or the associated |.append style| variant. See section~\ref{sec:styles} for more detail.
\end{enumerate}
I apologize for any inconvenience caused by these changes.

This library requires at least \PGF\ version $2.00$. At the time of this writing, many \TeX-distributions still contain the older \PGF\ version $1.18$, so it may be necessary to install a recent \PGF\ prior to using \PGFPlots.

\subsection{The Team}
\PGFPlots\ has been written by Christian Feuersänger and Pascal Wolkotte as a spare time project. We hope it is useful and provides valueable plots.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
I thank God for all hours of enjoyed programming. I thank Pascal Wolkotte, author of package |pgfgraph|, who joined development and contributed code for axis lines and tick alignment. Furthermore, I thank Dr.~Schweitzer for many fruitful discussions and Dr.~Meine for his ideas and suggestions.

Last but not least, I thank Till Tantau and Mark Wibrow for their excellent graphics (and more) package \PGF\ and \Tikz\ which is the base of \PGFPlots.
