\maketitle
\begin{abstract}%
\PGFPlots\ draws high--quality function plots in normal or logarithmic scaling with a user-friendly interface. The user supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots and \PGFPlots\ applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots. It is based on Till Tantau's package \PGF/\Tikz.
\end{abstract}
\tableofcontents
\section{Introduction}
This package provides tools to generate plots and labeled axes easily. It draws normal plots, logplots and semi-logplots. Axis ticks, labels, legends (in case of multiple plots) can be added with key-value options. It can cycle through a set of predefined line/marker/color specifications. In summary, its purpose is to simplify the generation of high-quality function plots, especially for use in scientific contexts (logplots).

It is build completely on \Tikz\ and \PGF\ and may be used as \Tikz\ library. 

\section{Upgrade remarks}
This release provides a lot of improvements which can be found in all detail in ``\texttt{changelog.txt}'' for interested readers. However, some attention is required for upgrades:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have re-implemented legends as \Tikz-matrizes and the default legend styles have been changed accordingly.

	Please \emph{replace} 
	\begin{lstlisting}
\tikzstyle{every axis legend}=[...]
	\end{lstlisting}
	\emph{with} 
\begin{lstlisting}
\tikzstyle{every axis legend}+=[...].
\end{lstlisting}

	\item Update each \lstinline!\axispath...! command in your files. You will need to use \lstinline!axis cs! as coordinate system to apply any axis transformations. See sections~\ref{sec:axispath} and~\ref{sec:axis:coords} for details.

	\item The manual file name has been renamed.
