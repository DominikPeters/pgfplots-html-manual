% make sure that if the floating point unit becomes a separate
% library, we can still load it properly:
\pgfplots@iffileexists{pgflibraryfpu.code.tex}{%
	\usepgflibrary{fpu}%
}{%
	\pgfplots@iffileexists{pgflibraryfloatingpoint.code.tex}{%
		\usepgflibrary{floatingpoint}%
	}{%
		\relax
		% Seems there is no such library. That's ok, it's just
		% a future-compatibility check.
		% Process as usually.
	}%
}%


% check whether we need to load supplementary code.
% The development of pgfplots and pgf is intermingled, so pgfplots
% always uses up-to-date pgf CVS versions - the relevant complements between
% PGF 2.00 and PGF CVS are loaded here:
\pgfutil@ifundefined{pgfmath@basic@ln@}{}{\endinput}
%\pgfkeysifdefined{/pgf/number format/min exponent for 1000 sep}{\endinput}{}


\pgfutil@ifundefined{pgfmathlessthan@}{%
	\let\pgfmathlessthan@=\pgfmathless@
	\let\pgfmathgreaterthan@=\pgfmathgreater@
