% Package pgfplots
%
% Provides a user-friendly interface to create function plots (normal
% plots, semi-logplots and double-logplots).
% 
% It is based on Till Tantau's PGF package.

% This library adds support for high-level instructions for "fill area
% between two arbitrary plots of functions".
%
% It activates the syntax
%
% 	\addplot fill between[of=A and B];
%
% where A and B are two plots named by 'name path='.
%
% In fact, this here is not much more than a low-level invocation of
% \pgfpathfillbetween
% and a couple of styles. It could become a TikZ library because it
% actually works on any two named paths, but it has its restrictions
% regarding the supported input paths: both need to be plots of
% functions (non-intersecting, should have at most one function value
% for each canvas X coord)
