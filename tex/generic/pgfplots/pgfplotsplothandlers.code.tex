% Package pgfplots
%
% Provides a user-friendly interface to create function plots (normal
% plots, semi-logplots and double-logplots).
% 
% It is based on Till Tantau's PGF package.

% Plot handlers are extended versions of the plot handlers of PGF with
% backwards compatibility.
%
% To remind ourselfes: PGF plot handlers work like this
% \pgfplotstreamstart
% \pgfplotstreampoint{...}
% \pgfplotstreampoint{...}
% \pgfplotstreampoint{...}
% \pgfplotstreampoint{...}
% \pgfplotstreamend
%
% and that's it.
%
% PGFPlots plot handlers also contain these three macros, and it uses
% them for the same tasks. In addition, it supports a set of further
% macros for every plot handler:
%
% \pgfplotsplothandlersurveystart
% \pgfplotsplothandlersurveypoint
% \pgfplotsplothandlersurveyend
%
% and serialization methods
% \pgfplotsplothandlerserializepointto
% \pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializepointfrom
% \pgfplotsplothandlerserializestateto
% \pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializepointfrom
%
% The idea is as follows:
% During \addplot, PGFPLots performs a survey phase. Survey means:
% nothing will be drawn, only stats will be collected. In this phase,
% the \pgfplotsplothandlersurvey* methods will be invoked; followed by
% a serialization.
%
% Then, when every plot has been surveyed, PGFPlots calls
% \pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializestatefrom{<serialized state>}
% \pgfplotstreamstart
% foreach <serizalized point> {
% 	\pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializepointfrom{<serialized point>}
% 	apply data transformations 
% 	handle plot marks
% 	\pgfplotstreampoint{\pgfplotsqpointxy{<x>}{<y}}
% }
% \pgfplotstreamend
%
% Thus, the PGF basic level streams can (but don't need to) make use
% of the macros assigned by the
% \pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializepointfrom and
% \pgfplotsplothandlerdeserializestatefrom.
